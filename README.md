# updatedportfolio3
Updated Portfolio #3 with added information and features, as well as easy to navigate.  Decided to start over with a proper layout using HTML/BOOTSTRAP and CSS. This is a easy user interface framework, that will allow the user and or potential employer to view quickly and easily, yet hit all the marks needed to continue the interest for an interview. 
I would like to add some Animation that was learned over project 2 just to make this fun and keep it simple.
As well as add some employer and reference options if that is needed for the future!
